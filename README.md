# Tableau-Visualization
Visualizing various data sets using advanced Tableau features

Several datasets have been used to visualize on Tableau using several of its features for creative graphs and maps.

I have started off by creating a simple US map showing sales of SuperStore according to states using labels and different colors.
Also worked on creating calculated fields and using them to differentiate on the basis of color. 
Using calculated fields gives us a better understanding, especially in case of profit margin calculations.
Different fonts in labels and formatting options have been used for better visual structure.

Also worked on exporting tableau worksheets as images which have been attached in the repository which can be used in presentations.
Worked using time series, aggregation and granularity theories. Keeping these in mind, we always tend to get more efficient plots.

Area chart have been created for easy comparison of sales of a specific organization and its target values.

Addidng filters and quick filters to worksheets lets us easily navigate to different data visuals based on year or a specific category.
Filters can also be easily formatted into sliders which gives an even more attractive and efficient structure to our plots.

Worked on several maps like the US map, the UK map to show and compare the sales of items across the country divided region-wise.
Images of the maps have also been attached in the repository. I have also used scatter plot feature for better outcomes.

Several filters have been used which come under actions of the worksheet. By using such actions, we can easily relate two or more 
worksheets on tableau and can be easily visualized based on a specific selection on a single worksheet.
I have created 2 dashboards using interactive action filters which make the dashboard more interactive to the user.

Also worked on joins and data blending and clearly classified between the two based on granularity of data.
Dual axis charts have also been created and displayed the importance of axis synchronization.
Used bins and parameters too for effective visualization.
